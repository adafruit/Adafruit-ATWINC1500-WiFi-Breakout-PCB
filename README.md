These 802.11bgn-capable WiFi modules are the best new thing for networking your devices, with SSL support and rock solid performance - running our adafruit.io MQTT demo for a full weekend straight with no hiccups (it would have run longer but we had to go to work, so we unplugged it). We like these so much, they've completely replaced the CC3000 module on all our projects.

The Adafruit ATWINC1500 WiFi Breakouts use SPI to communicate, so with about 6 wires, you can get your wired up and ready to go. And scanning/connecting to networks is very fast, a few seconds.

These modules work with 802.11b, g, or n networks & supports WEP, WPA and WPA2 encryption. You can use them in Soft AP mode to create an ad-hoc network. For secure client connections, there is TLS 1.2 support in firmware 19.4.4!
